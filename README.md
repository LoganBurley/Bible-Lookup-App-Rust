# Bible-Lookup-App-Rust
My first Rust project

This project implements file reading and writing in python. It 
asks the user for a book of the Bible, a chapter and a verse. 
It checks for books in a csv file for abbreviations. It searches 
for the referenced book, returns the verse if it is found and 
appends it to a new file.

This was a simple project to become familiar with the Rust programming language.
